# Restaurant website for the Odin Project

This exercise was meant to get us used to working with webpack. On [my implementation](https://paposeco.github.io/flosdiner/) I created a page for a Diner that only serves breakfast food.

## Modules

I enjoyed working with modules. It helps to keep the code organized and clean. However, it's annoying that you can't link the menu, for example, to someone, and instead you have to link to the entire website.

## Styling

I went for a very minimalist look, which I quite enjoy. I particularly like how the menu turned out. I will now list the sources for the photos (all from unsplash):
